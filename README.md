# Comparing-Mulilingual-Embedding-Techniques-with-BERTopic

We perform a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art (SOTA) multilingual sentence and document encoders in order to determine which embedding model performs best for topic modeling in BERTopic, comparing it to English-only embedding model as a baseline and show that it performs at or above state-of-the-art level in zero-shot transfer settings.
